# Fibonacci-Stuff
These algorithms do not use loops for nth-terms for things that are typically expressed recursively.
	
For all of these algorithms, there is the option to print and return the number of interest. These algorithms are inteded for usage on the command line, so everything is set up to print out of main (but can be adjusted easily).
	
For the Fibonacci and Lucas sequences, the algorithms can print/return the nth term, and add up all of the terms in the sequence up to a given nth term (for fun). In addition, one of the algorithms can print/return the nth triangle number that is also a square number. See the file appropriately named for reference.
